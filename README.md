# Data Warehousing with BigQuery

## Project Title: Data Warehousing with BigQuery

### Project Description:
In this project, we aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a Superstore dataset using Google BigQuery. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from the data and provide actionable recommendations for the business. By leveraging BigQuery's powerful querying capabilities, we will explore various aspects of the Superstore's operations, focusing on customer sales, profit margins, product categories, and regional performance.

## Project Steps:

### 1. Data Import:
- **Import the dataset into Google BigQuery**:
  - Use Google Cloud Storage to upload the Superstore dataset.
  - Load the dataset into a BigQuery table for further analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning:
- **Address missing or inconsistent data**:
  - Identify missing values and choose appropriate methods for imputation (e.g., KNN Imputer or other suitable strategies).
  - Ensure the consistency of data types (e.g., converting date columns to `DATE` format).
- **Ensure data integrity**:
  - Perform checks for duplicates and outliers.
  - Confirm that all necessary fields are present and properly formatted.

### 3. BQ Queries:
Here are the key analysis tasks to derive insights from the Superstore dataset:

- **Identify the top 10 customers with the highest total sales for each region**.
- **For each order shipped in the first year, calculate the profit margin (profit as a percentage of sales) and identify orders with a profit margin above 20%**.
- **Analyze the sales trend for each category in the Superstore dataset over the last three years. Identify categories with a consistent increase in sales**.
- **Determine the most popular product subcategories within each category in the Superstore dataset based on total sales**.
- **Identify the most profitable sales representatives for each region in the Superstore dataset**.

### 4. Analysis Documentation:
For each of the above analyses, provide the following documentation:

- **Rationale for the analysis**: Explain why the specific analysis is relevant to the business objectives and how it helps derive insights.
- **Methodology**: Describe how the analysis was constructed, detailing the use of various functions and techniques to retrieve meaningful insights.
- **Visualization**: Based on the results from the analysis, create appropriate visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, or pie charts to illustrate trends, rankings, and key metrics.
- **Insights**: Highlight the key takeaways from each analysis, such as identifying top customers, profitable sales representatives, and popular product categories, along with recommendations for improving sales performance or targeting specific regions.

## Expected Outcomes:
- **Customer Insights**: Identify the top-performing customers in each region and explore their purchase behavior.
- **Profitability Analysis**: Determine which orders are highly profitable and provide recommendations to increase the profit margin.
- **Sales Trends**: Analyze the performance of different product categories and subcategories over time, identifying areas with consistent growth or decline.
- **Regional Performance**: Evaluate which regions and sales representatives are most profitable and contribute significantly to the overall sales.

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Google BigQuery**: For data warehousing and querying.
- **Google Data Studio or Tableau**: For visualizing the results of BigQuery queries.
- **Python (Optional)**: For additional data analysis and visualization (using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.).
